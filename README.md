# Deep-Learning-Frame-Level-Speech-Recognition-NEU
Deep Learning | Numpy | Mel Spectrogram | Speech Recognition | MLPs | Phonemes

# Describe
* Implemented a MLPs to recognize the frame level of Mel Spectrogram to phonemes.
* Improved the accuracy by using context which is inspired from the idea of n-grams.
* Achieved 77.40% accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.

For track the trainning process, I print too much training result which is unnecessary...
